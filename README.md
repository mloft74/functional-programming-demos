# About

This repo is part of the USU Software Development Workshop [functional programming presentation](https://github.com/USUSDW/functional-basics). This repo contains a few examples and demonstrations of functional programming. Java and JavaScript make most of the demonstrations, and C# and Haxe are simply used to compare and contrast some differences in how languages approach implementation of functional programming.

Go check out [USUSDW](https://github.com/USUSDW) and [Hunter Henrichsen](https://github.com/hhenrichsen), who also presented.

## Java

This was built with Java 14, but should run with any version past 10. Run `javac` on a demo file, then run `java` on the respective `.class` file that is created.

> javac ClosureDemo.js

> java ClosureDemo

## JavaScript

Open [index.html](js/index.html) in your browser, open the developer tools, and call functions from the dev console.

## C#

Built with .NET Core 3.1. Either `dotnet run` or `dotnet build` and running the resulting binary of `bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/cs`.

## Haxe

Built with Haxe 4. Run the Haxe compiler `haxe build.hxml`, then `node bin/main.js`.
